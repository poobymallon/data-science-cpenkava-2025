*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying "pure sampling" of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and PI) to support engineering design.

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub) that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat transfer to fluid-suspended particles[1]. These simulations were carried out to help study a novel design of [solar receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power), though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your local `./data/` folder.

```{r data-download-unzip}

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain (RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right). Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are "hot spots" where hot particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap` gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

### **q1** Perform your "initial checks" to get a sense of the data.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Perform your initial checks
glimpse(df_psaap)
summary(df_psaap)
```

**Observations**:

-   there are 22 variables
-   they all take numerical values, and they operate on a range - none of them take discrete values of just like 1 and 0, they operate on a continuous spectrum that makes sense for the context of that particular value.
-   there seems to be values that are inputs that are characteristic of the system, outputs from the simulation, and then x, which is an identification of where in the simulated system we're talking about and idx which is just the number simulation we're talking about

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions `W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx
df_psaap %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = T_norm, color = factor(idx))) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +  
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "T_norm vs x by Simulation Number",
    x = "x",             
    y = "T_norm",            
    color = "idx (Simulation Number)"      
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation sets.

```{r data-split}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors (features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables---at least at a *high level*---can help us to avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You'll explore this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

```{r q3-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance
mse(fit_baseline, df_train)
mse(fit_cheat, df_train)
mse(fit_nonphysical, df_train)

rsquare(fit_baseline, df_train)
rsquare(fit_cheat, df_train)
rsquare(fit_nonphysical, df_train)
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
    -   when using the mse to compare the models (which we can do because they are all on the same data), the mse tells us that fit_cheat is best, then fit_baseline, then fit_nonphysical.
    -   the R-values for these indicate the same conclusion, also showcasing that fit_nonphysical is laughably bad
-   What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective predictor?
    -   from our handy-dandy table, avg_T is an output that represents "Plane-averaged fluid temperature"
        -   given that norm_T is an output that represents "Normalized fluid temperature rise," these variables are almost identical in what they are measuring and are derived from the same measurements, which is where the effectiveness in prediction comes from. The only difference between the two is that norm_T is avg_T normalized to the fluid inlet temperature, T_f. We know this from the equation above: norm_T = (avg_T - T_f)/T_f, so the two have a direct mathematical relationship and thus are very, very good at predicting each other.
-   Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new* value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
    -   No we would not - both of them are an output derived from temperature measurement, which means that you would have to get the same data to find either of them (i.e. why would you even use them as a predictor bc you can only either have the data necessary to find neither of them or both of them.)
-   What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical meaning?
    -   coming back to our handy-dandy table, idx is a metadata thing that simply represents what enumerated simulation we are talking about. it doesn't mean anything physically – it just tells you which data go together to represent different simulations.

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)

fit_q4 %>% tidy()

fit_x <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_tf <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ T_f)

# tidy(fit_x)
# tidy(fit_tf)


```

**Observations**:

-   Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of the model?

    -   We are excluding the idx, avg_q, avg_T, and rms_T columns from the linear model.
    -   These are important to leave out because they are, respectively, the number simulation (which has no significance at all for the reasons discussed above), the "Plane-averaged heat flux," the "Plane-averaged fluid temperature," and the "Normalized fluid temperature rise." The last three of these are outputs from the data collected – they are all ways of describing the temperature and heat data from the simulation, which means that they already capture information that is also captured by T_norm, which make them sort of artificially good in describing T_norm without any real meaning.

-   Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?

    -   based on the p-values (our statistically significant qualifier being p\<0.05), the inputs that are significant are x, L, W, U_0, C_fp, d_p, and l_0

-   What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression coefficient for `T_f`?

    from the estimates column:

    -   1.018 for x
    -   -3.791\*10\^-4 for T_f

```{r}
df_psaap %>% 
  summarize(
    x_sd = sd(x),
    tf_sd = sd(T_f)
  )
```

-   What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the standard deviation of `T_f`?
    -   standard deviation of x in df_psaap is 0.2805
    -   standard deviation of T_f in df_psaap is 38.942
-   How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients for `x` and `T_f`?
    -   the standard deviation captures the variance, and the regression coefficient is the beta value that is essentially the slope of the linear model that captures the relationship between the variable and its predicted output, so we can see how the model lets the variance of the variables influence it by taking the product of the sd and regression coefficient. to put it more clearly, they are related in that the regression coefficent adapts to the standard deviation for how the model wants that variance captured within it.
-   Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on the output `T_norm`; so they are all "significant" in that sense. What does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance for interpreting regression coefficients?
    -   Statistical significance defined by a p-value of 0.05 or lower is somewhat arbitrary - this is just a value that statisticians have declared is important for stat reasons, but there can still be significant inputs above that. For example, C_fp gets determined as a statistically significant value, but lam_f does not - they both waver around that 0.05 value, but depending on how your random variables come out, you may end up seemingly arbitrarily choosing one and not the other.

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let's revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI). Let's fit a very simple model to these data, one which only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We'll also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the `setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

```{r data-simple-model}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the objects they are attempting to capture:

```{r data-simple-model-vis}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    size = 0.5
  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )
```

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation` observations.

**Punchline**:

-   Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
-   Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to *narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions. Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in uncertainty. We'll see this phenomenon in action with the following task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Run this code and interpret the results
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## NOTE: This chunk will use your model from q4; it will predict on the
##       validation data, add prediction intervals for every prediction,
##       and visualize the results on a predicted-vs-actual plot. It will
##       also compare against the simple `fit_simple` defined above.
bind_rows(
  df_psaap %>% 
    add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi") %>% 
    select(T_norm, pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr) %>% 
    mutate(model = "x only"),
  df_psaap %>% 
    add_uncertainties(fit_q4, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi") %>% 
    select(T_norm, pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr) %>% 
    mutate(model = "q4"),
) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(T_norm, pi_fit)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "grey80", size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = pi_lwr, ymax = pi_upr),
    width = 0
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  
  facet_grid(~ model, labeller = label_both) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs Actual",
    x = "Actual T_norm",
    y = "Predicted T_norm"
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this predicted-vs-actual plot?
    -   q4 tends to be more accurate. The points are closer to the 1:1 line, therefore the predicted and actual tend to be more equivalent
-   Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
    -   The x only model has a narrower prediction interval - it's predictions are not spread out along the vertical as far as the q4 is
-   How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
    -   fit q4 uses 18, while fit_simple just 1

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example, it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is *patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component* that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases---human behavior and variable material properties---we would be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term $\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below (use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level` argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing a CI or PI for the design prediction.

```{r q6-task}
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`

fit_q6 <- lm(T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0, data = df_train)

df_design_pred <-
  df_design %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_q6, interval = "prediction", level = 0.8, prefix = "pi")

df_design_pred %>% select(pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr)

```

**Recommendation**:

-   How much do you trust your model? Why?
    -   I have a medium amount of trust in my model - we have used 4 really good variables for our model, but not all of the statistically significant ones
    -   If we look at the r\^2 value for this model, we see that...
    -   

```{r}
rsquare(fit_q6, df_train)
rsquare(fit_q6, df_psaap)
```

-   ...
    -   it's about 0.66 for the training and real data, which is pretty decent for just 4 variables, but not stupendous or anything. Again, I'd say I have a medium amount of trust.

<!-- -->

-   What kind of interval---confidence or prediction---would you use for this task, and why?

    -   I would use a prediction interval here - I initially reasoned that we would want a confidence interval because we're not trying to capture all the possible next values with this model. The question states that we are looking for "a dependable range of values," which I would deem a good use case for the confidence interval, which tracks the mean trend. ***BUT*** then I read the point about one single prototype and not wanting to break any downstream equipment - so we are in fact looking for one singular future value might show up, so we would want a prediction interval

-   What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the validation data*; don't just use one single interval!) How does this compare with `pr_level`?

    ```{r}
    df_validate_pred <-
      df_validate %>%
      add_uncertainties(fit_q6, interval = "prediction", level = 0.8, prefix = "pi")

    coverage <- df_validate_pred %>%
      summarize(
        coverage = mean(T_norm >= pi_lwr & T_norm <= pi_upr)
      ) %>%
      pull(coverage)

    coverage
    ```

-   ...

    -   Looks like 93.33% of cases are in my prediction interval
        -   (Note: if you change that do a confidence, it becomes 36.67%)
        -   Those two stats make sense - a CI is not there to predict all the values, just get a mean trend, but a PI kind of is there to predict where the future values are going to lie.
        -   93.33% is plenty above than 0.8 (80%)

-   What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan around?

    -   I think that they could get away with just under what my prediction interval came up, but I'm not going to take any big chances, so I'll just round down and say to design for 1.46 to 2.29.

-   Are there any other recommendations you would provide?

    -   Consider the confidence interval instead if you want to see generally how to make the system after further testing with this new prototype.

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
